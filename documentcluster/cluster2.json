An Egyptian passport in the name of Rifai Qasim was found recently on the floor of the Southern Trailways bus depot in Charlotte, NC. Examined by the Charlotte police, the picture on this passport matches the appearance of a person using the name Omar Blakely, who was charged with the theft, on 1 October, 2003, of several items [total value: $3000] from an electronics supply store in Charlotte. Blakely gave his address as: 3131 Western Ave. in Charlotte. Blakely is now out on bail that was guaranteed by a bail bond company named BailOut, in Charlotte, NC.
