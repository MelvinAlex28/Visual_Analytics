Omari was badly wounded at the time, saying that he was shot while attempting to desert from an Al Qaeda insurgent group that had taken refuge near Parachinar on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Omari was placed in a hospital and, after his recovery, he was encouraged to talk about his Al Qaeda activities. Among the items of information Omari revealed was that he had been at the Farooq training facility in 2001 before the American presence in Afghanistan. He was shown photos of various persons and asked if he could identify any of them. One photo, that had been taken in Peshawar on 2 January, 2003, showed a group of four men. Omari said he knew three of them since they had been with him at the Farooq training camp. One man he identified as Dr. Badawi, the second he identified as Mamdouh al Hazmi, and the third he identified only as Hasham; Omari could not remember his first name. Omari said that all three were members of Al Qaeda..\n", "CIA_11": "A house at #88 Sahibzada Gul Rd. in Peshawar, suspected of being an Al Qaeda safe house, was raided on 15 May, 2003 by Pakistani Intelligence. Unfortunately, apparently being tipped-off, the occupants had fled the day before. However, in the mess they left behind, there were a few items of interest. One was an expired Pakistani passport issued to a person named Yasir Salman. Other items included a doctor's stethoscope; notes taken in Arabic on Legionella and gastroenteritis; and notes, written in Arabic, about the results of a May, 2002 project in the USA called TOPOFF I. In addition, an opened envelope addressed in Arabic to F. Badawi was found behind a cabinet in one of the rooms in this house. Finally, a note written in Arabic simply stated: \"Karachi, March 10, 2003, Safrygin, funds.\"..\n", "CIA_12": "A number of bombings were attempted in Casablanca on 16 May, 2003. Of five attempts only one succeeded in causing mass casualties. In four of the attempts that failed only the bombers were killed. These bombings are believed to have been the actions of local individuals who may have been trained by Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. A person believed to have been a participant in the successful bombing was apprehended on 18 June, 2003; his name is Mohamed Essabar. On interrogation, Essabar was asked to reveal the names of other participants, which, even under duress, he refused to do. However, when he was arrested he was carrying a note in Arabic signed by a person named A. Atmani. One person of interest having this name is Abdellah Atmani, who has been a resident of Casablanca all his life. During interviews with Atmani, it became clear that he had no part in the bombings on 16 May, 2003. However, his name was brought to our attention because Atmani works as a loading supervisor for the Holland Orange Shipping Lines that has offices and docks in Casablanca. Holland Orange ships make regular freight runs from Casablanca to a variety of locations along the east coast of the USA as well as to places in the Caribbean. Moroccan police reported that they were keeping Atmani under surveillance..\n", "CIA_13": "On 20 June, 2003, three men were arrested at # 71 Voorburg straat in Amsterdam. All three men were of Indonesian origin and had emigrated to The Netherlands in the mid 1990s. These men were arrested on evidence that they had formed a plan to destroy a number of Jewish synagogues in Amsterdam and in other places in The Netherlands. One person was identified as being of special interest to us; his name was established as Riduan Sungkar, who was born in Kuala Lumpur in 1974. When he was taken by the police, Sungkar was carrying an airline ticket from Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam to Chicago, IL with a connecting flight to Los Angeles, CA. The departure date on this ticket was 23 June, 2003. He was also carrying a Dutch passport in the name: Omar Evertts, giving his address as # 71 Voorburg straat, Amsterdam. In addition, he had a small notebook containing several names and addresses, two of which were of persons located in the Los Angeles area. They are: A. Somad, 235 Buckthorn St, Inglewood CA, and Y.

All he could say is that he knew they went north, most likely to Chitral. Asked to provide more information about the previous occupants, all he would say is that he knew they were Al Qaeda.

The three others killed were identified as: Abdul Jabarah [a Kuwaiti], Fahd Jehani [a Saudi], and Ramzi al Shibh [a Yemeni], all of whom are known members of Al Qaeda. Jehani seems to have been a courier since he was carrying a packet of messages. Most of the messages contained instructions for insurgent activities in Pakistan, including an attempt to be made on 1 October, 2004 to destroy police HQ in Karachi. But one message was addressed to S. H in Chitral that read; \"Allah, all praise to him, has provided the funds you need to finish your work.

The ambassador went on to say that he had worked at this embassy as a clerk during this time and had become attached to the three al Ghamdi sons. He added with regret that all three of the boys, whom he had watched grow up, left Saudi Arabia and that two of them had been killed fighting for Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.

This address belongs to an Irish pub operated by a man named Patrick O'alley. O'alley says he never heard of any person named Mehdi Rafiki. But a man using a French passport in the name Abu Hafs rented a car at the Canadauto Car Rental Agency in Montreal on 2 April, 2003. This rented car was never returned to this agency.

A check with USCIS reveals no evidence that he ever left the USA since his arrival. In addition, the name Jamal al Quso has been associated by an informant with Islamic Jihad, which is known to have a presence in Chicago. On 28 September, 2003 a house at 2211 Cermak Rd. in Chicago, said by the informer to be occupied by members of Islamic Jihad, was raided by an FBI team acting under a warrant. One person, Abdul Murad, was the only person at this residence at the time of the raid. Thirty kilos, of C-4 plastic explosives were found at this residence along with an additional 25 kilos of Semtex. Maps of O'Hare Airport and diagrams of the Sears Tower were also confiscated.

He attended another meeting of this militia group in Mineral Wells, Texas on 16 June, 2003. An FBI informant who attends the meetings of this militia group developed a friendship with Shamrani and was invited to his home at 3236 Pine St. in Bellaire, Texas. The informant says he there saw elaborate diagrams of the Houston Ship Channel and detailed plans for Reliant Stadium and the Galleria Shopping Mall in Houston. The informant also said that Shamrani revealed his association with an Islamic group that had many of the same objectives as God's Aryan Militia including the elimination of Zioni st influence on the US government.
